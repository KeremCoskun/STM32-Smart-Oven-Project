# STM32-Smart-Oven-Project

We have created a smart oven design to increase usability. In addition to ordinary ovens, this oven can be remotely controlled via Bluetooth. In addition, the oven can send notifications to the user about the cooking processes. If the oven is not used for a long time, the deep sleep mode is activated.
In order to perform these operations, two heater plates, fan, temperature sensor, flame sensor, LCD display, Bluetooth module and many other suppliers are used together with the stm32f103c6 microprocessor. The reason why we prefer this microprocessor is that it is affordable in terms of performance and contains enough pins for our needs.
We have developed a simple mobile application to send data via Bluetooth connection.
